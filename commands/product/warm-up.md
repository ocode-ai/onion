# Project Warm-up

To prepare for this session, please:

1 - Meta Specs

- Review the index.md of the META SPECS for this project and memorize it so you know which files you can read later when the need arises.
- Meta specs are located in the docs/meta-specs/ folder of the project

2 - Review the README.md at the root of this project. Also, keep a list of files in the docs/ folder in your context so you can refer to them later when the need arises.

You can access these files directly through the file system or through the `code-expert` tool you have access to.

The project name will be provided as arguments: #$ARGUMENTS
