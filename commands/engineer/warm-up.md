# Project Warm-up

To prepare for this session, please:

1 - Review the README.md at the root of this project. Also, keep a list of files in the docs/ folder in your context so you can refer to them later when needed.

2 - Meta Specs

- Review the index.md in the META SPECS of this project and memorize it so you know which files you can read later when needed.
- Meta specs are located in the docs/meta-specs/ folder of the project
