## Context Architecture Design

**IMPORTANT: Create a multi-file structure with an index.md that links to separate files for each layer. Do NOT create one large file.**

**Implementation Approach:**
1. **First**: Create `index.md` with the project profile and layer links
2. **Then**: Create individual files for each layer as needed
3. **Finally**: Ensure all links in the index work correctly

**File Naming Convention:**
- Use UPPERCASE for generic documentation files (e.g., `CODEBASE_GUIDE.md`)
- Use lowercase for project-specific files (e.g., `project_charter.md`) 
- Keep filenames descriptive and consistent

### Create an Index File First

**Create: `index.md` (or `technical_context.md`)**
```markdown
## Project Context Profile

### Basic Project Information
[Include the project profile information here]

---

## Layer 1: Core Project Context

- [Project Charter](project_charter.md)
- [Architecture Decision Records](adr/)

## Layer 2: AI-Optimized Context Files

- [AI Development Guide](CURSOR.meta.md) - Example CURSOR.md file for project level  
- [Codebase Navigation Guide](CODEBASE_GUIDE.md)

## Layer 3: Domain-Specific Context

- [Business Logic Documentation](BUSINESS_LOGIC.md)
- [API Specifications](API_SPECIFICATION.md)

## Layer 4: Development Workflow Context

- [Development Workflow Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [Troubleshooting Guide](TROUBLESHOOTING.md)

- **AI Development Guide:** `[Role/Person]` - Updated as coding standards evolve
- **Business Logic:** `[Role/Person]` - Updated when business rules change
- **API Specs:** `[Role/Person]` - Updated with API changes

### Update Triggers

**When to update documentation:**
- [ ] New major features added
- [ ] Architecture decisions made
- [ ] Business rules change
- [ ] Performance issues discovered
- [ ] Security requirements updated
- [ ] Team composition changes
- [ ] Technology stack updates

### Quality Assurance Process

- [ ] Language is clear and unambiguous
- [ ] AI can understand and use the information
- [ ] Human developers find it helpful
- [ ] Links and references are valid

---

## AI Integration Guidelines

### Context File Organization

**Recommended file structure for AI consumption:**
```
/specs/technical/               # or /docs/context/
  index.md                     # Main index with links to all layers
  project_charter.md           # Layer 1: Core context
  /adr/                        # Layer 1: Architecture decisions
    001-database-choice.md
    002-authentication-strategy.md
  CURSOR.meta.md              # Layer 2: AI development guide
  CODEBASE_GUIDE.md           # Layer 2: Navigation guide
  BUSINESS_LOGIC.md           # Layer 3: Domain knowledge
  API_SPECIFICATION.md        # Layer 3: API documentation
  CONTRIBUTING.md             # Layer 4: Development workflow
  TROUBLESHOOTING.md          # Layer 4: Issue resolution
```

**Key Benefits of This Structure:**
- **Modular**: Each file focuses on a specific concern
- **Linked**: Index file provides navigation and overview
- **Maintainable**: Updates target specific files, not one large document
- **AI-Friendly**: Clear file names and focused content improve AI understanding

### AI Tool Configuration

**For GitHub Copilot:**
- Ensure context files are in repository root or `/docs`
- Use clear, descriptive file names
- Include relevant examples and code snippets

**For Cursor AI Development:**
- Create consolidated context packages for complex discussions
- Maintain current context summaries for long development sessions
- Include relevant error logs and debugging context

**For Cursor/Windsurf:**
- Configure `.cursorrules` or equivalent with project-specific guidelines
- Reference key documentation files in AI instructions
- Maintain workspace-specific context configurations

### Context Compression Strategies

**For large projects, consider:**
- **Hierarchical documentation** - overview → detailed sections
- **Context summaries** - condensed versions of key information
- **Dynamic context loading** - context relevant to current work
- **Cross-references** - links between related documentation
